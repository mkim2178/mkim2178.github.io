** ⚠️ Work in Progress: This note is currently being updated!


outline of the note:

≥ -> subtract surplus and add artificial
= -> add artificial


phase 1: solve for artificial problem

w = a_1 + a_2 (rewrite this with x_1, x_2, s_2)

simplex

if w = 0 -> go phase 2, otherwise, this problem is infeasible (stop)

phase 2

re-write z with non-basic variable

simplex

write optimal solutions
